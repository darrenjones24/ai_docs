# File: settings.py

## Summary

This code defines default file suffixes and directories to include/exclude when generating documentation. It uses `argparse` to handle command-line arguments for specifying the repository name, target directory, and directories to exclude. It also retrieves the Gemini model and project ID from environment variables.


## Logic Flow

The Python code begins by importing necessary modules like `typing`, `argparse`, and `os`. It then defines three sets as constants: `DEFAULT_INCLUDE_SUFFIXES`, `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_SUFFIXES`, and `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_DIRS`, containing file extensions to include, file extensions to exclude, and directory names to exclude, respectively.

The core logic resides in the `parse_args` function. This function uses the `argparse` module to define and parse command-line arguments. It defines three arguments: `-n` or `--name` for the repository name (defaulting to "repo_name"), `-d` or `--directory` for the top-level directory to scan (defaulting to the current working directory), and `-e` or `--exclude_dirs` for a comma-separated list of directories to exclude (defaulting to an empty string).  The function returns the parsed arguments object.

Finally, the code retrieves environment variables. It attempts to retrieve the value of `GEMINI_MODEL` from the environment, defaulting to "gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25" if the environment variable is not set.  Similarly, it attempts to retrieve the value of `GEMINI_PROJECT_ID` from the environment, defaulting to "sre-ai-dev" if the environment variable is not set.

In essence, this code sets up the configuration for a documentation generation tool. It defines default settings for file inclusion and exclusion, allows the user to override these settings via command-line arguments, and fetches necessary configuration values from environment variables. The purpose of the code is to prepare and collect the configuration data required for the rest of the documentation generation process.
